## ðŸš€ Overview
![STREAM-Net](figures/figure1.png)

Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a popular, non-invasive, contactless technique for detecting physiological signals with promising applications in health monitoring. Recent advances leverage deep learning to overcome challenges such as motion artifacts, redundancy, and external noise in video-based rPPG signal extraction.

We propose **STREAM-Net**, a bilateral spatio-temporal network designed to estimate blood volume pulse (BVP) signals by analyzing human physiological processes in video frames. The network uses spatio-temporal branches with lateral attention and multi-scale feature integration to enhance rPPG signal extraction.

- The **spatio-temporal lateral attention module** integrates spatial-temporal features at multiple resolutions, preserving essential dependencies between spatial and temporal data.
- The **multi-scale feature enhancement module** encodes high-level features to refine spatial features with distinct local and global representations.

Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate the superior performance and robustness of our method. Additionally, we quantify ***predictive uncertainty*** using **[Monte Carlo dropout](link)**, demonstrating the modelâ€™s repeatability and reliability.
